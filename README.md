# Financial Performance Predictor


## Overview

This project leverages advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict company financial performance and identify economic trends. Using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, we've developed sophisticated models to forecast financial metrics and provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Features

- üßπ Data preprocessing and cleaning
- üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with interactive visualizations
- üîç Feature engineering and selection
- ü§ñ Multiple predictive models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forests
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- üéõÔ∏è Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance
- ‚úÖ Model validation and performance evaluation

## Dataset

The primary dataset used is the "Company Financials Dataset" from Kaggle, which includes:
- Segment information
- Country data
- Product details
- Sales figures
- Profit metrics
- Temporal data (dates and month numbers)

## Key Findings

- Identified crucial indicators of financial performance through regression analysis and EDA
- Developed models with high accuracy in forecasting financial trends
- Uncovered patterns in gross sales across different segments and countries
- Analyzed profit distribution across various markets
